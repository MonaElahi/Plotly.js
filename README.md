# Overview of Project

Human body has thousands of bacteria species in different parts of the body. ideal bacterial species have ability to synthesis protein taste like beef. with the help bacteria sample that colonize in belly button has been collected from volunteers with individual ids to create a dashboard to select if with demographic information.  

# Purpose

With the help of completed panel for demographic information, visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, identify whether that species is found in their navel.

# Results:

### Belly Button Biodiversty Dashboard

When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940â€™s data displays in the dashboard, 
and the bar chart has top 10 sample_values, values, otu_ids as labels and three charts.

### Dashboard Charts

* Bar Chart: _Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found_
* Bubble Chart: _Bacteria Cultures Per Sample_
* Gauge Chart: _Belly Button Washing Frequency_
